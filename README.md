# Adaptation-in-Cloud-Computing
Term paper on Adaptation in cloud computing. 

## Description 
During my coursework on Adaptive Software Engineering, I took the initiative to
complete a research project on Reinforcement Learning Methods in Adaptation in
Cloud Computing. This project provided me with the opportunity to apply my
knowledge of software engineering and reinforcement learning to real-world chal-
lenges in cloud computing.I successfully completed the term paper and made the
results available on GitHub for future referen

# Credits 

This work was carried out with guidance of Prof. Naveen Sharma, Dpt. of Software Engineering, Rochester Institute of Technology,
during his visit and teaching of Adaptive Software Engineering at IIT Jammu. I thank him for his immense support and guidance on good research practises.
